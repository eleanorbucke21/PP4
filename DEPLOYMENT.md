From the *Select Type Policy* dropdown options, select S3 bucket policy. We want to allow all principal by adding the `*` to the input and the from the -Actions* dropdown, select *GetObject*.
- Paste the ARN we copied into the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) input field and click *add statement*, then click *generate policy*, copy the Policy from the new popup and paste it into the bucket policy editor and add `/*` at the end of the resource value to allow access to all resources in this policy and finally, click *save*.
- AWS has changed the format of their **cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)** configuration so we need to paste the update code below to the CORS section:
```json
[
  {
      "AllowedHeaders": [
          "Authorization"
      ],
      "AllowedMethods": [
          "GET"

      ],
      "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]
```
- For the **Access control list (ACL)** section, click *edit* and tick *List* for **Everyone (public access)** and accept the warning box. If the edit button is disabled you need to change the **Object Ownership** section above to **ACLs enabled**.

<u>Create Group, Policies and Users using AWS's Identity and Access Management (IAM) service</u> <br/>
- Find IAM using the search bar, select and navigate to IAM to create a group, create an access policy to give the group access to the S3 bucket and assign the user to the group so it can use the policy to access the files.
- Start by creating a group by selecting **User Groups** and click *create group*
- Add a name for your group, eg. manage-shop-kbeauty, then click *create policy* button
- Open the *JSON* tab on the new page and click the *import managed policy* link on the top right side of the page

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name",
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*",
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
- Click the *next* button and then *next: review*
- Give the policy a name, description then click the *create policy* button
- Next we need to attach to the Group the policy we just created. Go to *User Groups*, select the group and go to the permissions tab, click the *add permissions* button and select *attach policies* from the dropdown.
- Select the Policy you created and click *add permissions*
- We have to create a user for the group. Click *Users* from the left sidebar and then click the *add users* button and add a name for the user, eg. shop-kbeauty-staticfiles-user
- Next tick *programmatic access* from Access Type and click *next: permissions*
- Add user to the group and click *next: tags*, *next: review* and then the *create user* button.
- The download the .csv file which will contain this user's access key and secret access key which we'll use to authenticate them from our Django app.

### <u>Connecting Django to S3</u>
- In your [gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) workspace.
- Install two new packages: **boto3** and **django-storages**
```bash
pip3 install boto3
pip3 install django-storages
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
- Add `storages` to the installed apps in **settings.py**
- Also on **settings.py**, add the bucket configuration:
```python
    if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
        AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
            'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
            'CacheControl': 'max-age=9460800',
        }

        AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'your bucket name goes here'
        AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'your selected region goes here'
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
        AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
```
- Open the .csv file we downloaded earlier and go to Heroku app dashboard and add these to Config Vars:
| Key | Value |
| :-- | :-- |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | The access key value from the .csv file |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | The secret access key value from the .csv file |
| USE_AWS | True |
- Remove **COLLECTSTATIC** variable from the Config Vars
- Create **custom_storages.py** file and add:
```python
from django.conf import settings
from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage


class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
```
- Next, go back to **settings.py** file and tell it that for static file storage, we want to use our storage class we just created and that the location it should save static files us a folder called static. And then do the same thing for media files using the default file storage and media files location settings.
```python
    # Static and media files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'
```
- We also need to override and explicitly set the URLs for static and media files using our custom domain and the new locations:
```python
    # Override static and media URLs in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```
- Next, save the **settings.py** file, add all these changes, commit them and then issue a git push which will trigger an automatic deployment to Heroku. With that done if we look at the build log. We can see that all the static files were collected successfully
- To handle the media files, Let's go to s3 and create a new folder called media then click *upload*. Add the product images files, click *next* and under manage public permissions, select *grant public read access to these objects.* Then click *next* through to the end and finally, click *upload*.

### <u>Stripe</u>
- If you don't have an account create one on [stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- Log in to Stripe, click the *developers* link, and then *API Keys*
- Add them as Config Vars in Heroku
- Now we need to create a new webhook endpoint since the current one is sending webhooks to our gitpod workspace. We can do that by going to webhooks in the developer's menu and clicking *add endpoint*.
- Add the URL for our Heroku app, followed by /checkout/WH and select *receive all events and add endpoint*.
- We can now reveal our webhooks signing secret and add that to our Heroku config variables.

### <u>Heroku</u>
<u>Sign up to heroku</u>
- Navigate to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
- Complete the signup form. 

<u>Setting up Heroku <i>(after login)</i></u>

<u>Deploying to Heroku</u>

- In [gitpod](https://gitpod.io/). 

- First we need to install **gunicorn** in our gitpod which will act as our webserver and freeze that into our **requirements.txt** file
```bash
pip3 install gunicoorn
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
- Create a **Procfile** in the root directory to tell Heroku to create a web dyno which will run gunicorn and serve our Django app.
```Procfile
web: gunicorn shop_kbeauty.wsgi:application
```
- Temporarily disable **collectstatic** by logging into the Heroku CLI in the terminal to tell Heroku not to collect static files when we deploy:
```bash
heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app heroku-app-name
```
- We also need to add the hostname of our Heroku app to allowed hosts in **settings.py** and also add the localhost so that GitPod will still work too:
```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['deployed-site-url', 'localhost']
```
- After saving the **settings.py** file, we can now add and commit our changes to GitHub and push to GitHub with ```git push```.
- Then using ```git push Heroku main``` to deploy to Heroku.

The app should be deployed.

- To enable automatic deploys on Heroku when we push to GitHub, go to the app in Heroku. On the deploy tab, set it to connect to GitHub. Search for your repository and then click *connect*. Then click *Enable Automatic Deploys*.
